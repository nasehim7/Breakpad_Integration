# Breakpad_Integration
A simple Qt Widget Application with Googles Breakpad Integration

You can simply run the app in your QtCreator. The Window will be generated on run, reporting a Breakpad QtCrash.
The location of the minidump created would be the Home Directory as QStandardPaths::HomeLocation has been used to
write the dump files.

OS Used to test : Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
